# Foodzy
A webapp to place requests for food which can be delivered by your campus mates.


## Starting the project

1. From the root directory run the command ``` npm install ```
2. Also install nodemon as dev dependancy with ``` npm install -D nodemon ```
3. Change into the client directory and run the command ``` npm install ```
4. From the root directory run the command ``` npm run dev ```

This will automatically start the backend and frontend servers for development.
